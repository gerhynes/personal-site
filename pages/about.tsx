        Hi, I&apos;m Gerard. I&apos;m a software engineer, former English
        teacher, and big nerd.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017 I decided to learn to code. For a few years I crammed in study
        around work, doing several rounds of the 100DaysOfCode challenge. In
        2021 I bit the bullet, did a Higher Diploma in Software Design and
        Development, and landed a software development internship. That led to
        my first software engineering role.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days my professional work focuses on real-time data reporting
        microservices with Scala, Kafka, and Kubernetes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve written tutorials for{" "}
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/gerardhynes/">
          freeCodeCamp
        </a>{" "}
        on topics from Kafka to PostgreSQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript was the first programming langauge I learned and I still love
        it. When I can, I enjoy building sites and apps with the{" "}
        <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a>. If you&apos;re wondering,
        this is a{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/gerhynes/personal-site">Next.js</a> site.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love fantasy and science fiction, once did a PhD on J.R.R. Tolkien,
        and enjoy playing tabletop role-playing games with my friends and
        family. If you ever meet me, online or offline, labhair Gaeilge liom ðŸ‘‹.
