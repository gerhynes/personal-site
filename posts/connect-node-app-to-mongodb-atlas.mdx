MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database choice for Node apps. There's a reason that the acronyms MERN stack, MEAN stack and even MEVN stack exist to describe an app built on MongoDB, Express, a JavaScript framework (whether React, Angular or Vue), and Node.

If you're learning how to work with MongoDB and Node, setting up a database on your own computer can be a little bit of a headache. Thankfully, MongoDB offer a cloud-based database platform, [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

I recently built a few projects with Node and MongoDB Atlas and felt it might be useful to write up a quick guide to how to get the two to talk to each other.

### Step 1 - Set up your MongoDB Atlas Account and Cluster

![MongoDB Atlas account setup page](./images/posts/connect-node-app-to-mongodb-atlas/mongodb-atlas-account-setup.png)

First things first, go to the [MongoDB Atlas website](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create a free account. You can choose whatever name you want for your organization and project. Choose JavaScript as your preferred language.

![MongoDB Atlas create cluster page](./images/posts/connect-node-app-to-mongodb-atlas/mongodb-atlas-create-cluster.png)

Next choose a free shared cluster. This will be enough for demos and small personal projects.

When you're invited to create a starter cluster, you can leave the Cloud Provider and Region as the defaults (unless you have strong feelings about them) and click **Create Cluster**.

![MongoDB Atlas dashboard](./images/posts/connect-node-app-to-mongodb-atlas/mongodb-atlas-dashboard.png)

You'll now be brought to your admin dashboard. Click on **Create a New Cluster**. This can take a couple of minutes.

Once your cluster is ready, click on the **Connect** button in the sandbox.

![MongoDB Atlas IP and user setup](./images/posts/connect-node-app-to-mongodb-atlas/mongodb-atlas-ip-user.png)

Allow access from all IP addresses. This would be a terrible idea in production but this is just a demo for learning purposes.

Next, create a new user for the database and choose a password. Store these somewhere safe, like your password manager.

![MongoDB Atlas connect modal](./images/posts/connect-node-app-to-mongodb-atlas/mongodb-atlas-connect-modal.png)

Now click on **Choose a connection method**.

Select **Connect your application**

![MongoDB Atlas database URI selection](./images/posts/connect-node-app-to-mongodb-atlas/mongodb-atlas-connect-cluster.png)

Under **Add your connection string into your application code** you'll see a URI with the format `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/<db-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`. The username, cluster-name and db-name fields will be automatically filled out.

Copy this URI to your clipboard. You'll need it in a minute.

### Step 2 - Make a Node App if you don't already have one

If you don't have a Node app to hand, you can [download the starter code for a very basic Express app from this repo](https://github.com/gerhynes/node-mongodb-atlas/tree/starter-code).

Run `npm install` to install Express, the only dependency.

Your `app.js` file should look like this.

```js
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const port = 3000;

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Your app is listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

In your command line, run `node app.js` and you should see the confirmation message that your app is listening on a particular port.

### Step 3 - Store Environmental Variables

Remember your MongoDB Atlas URI? You don't want to just paste that into your code where it could get committed to Git and potentially publicly exposed.

Instead, we're going to save it as an environmental variable.

Install the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) with `npm install dotenv`.

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project, paste in your URI, and assign it to a `DB_URI` variable. Make sure your version includes your password as well as your username, cluster name and database name.

```js
// .env
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/<db-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### Step 4 - Configure your Database Connection

To keep things organized, I keep my database config in its own file.

In the root of your project, create a `db.js` file. This will contain all the configuration for connecting to your database.

We're going to use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to handle connecting to our database.

Install Mongoose with `npm install mongoose` and import it into `db.js`.

Import your database URI as `db` from `process.env.DB_URI`.

Create a `connectDB` function. Make sure you mark it as an `async` function as it will take some amount of time to connect to your database.

Inside `connectDB`, create a `try-catch` block to handle any errors that occur.

In the `try` block, await `mongoose.connect()`. Pass it the `db` variable and a settings object. In the settings object, set `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` to `true`. This will prevent Mongoose from giving you warnings. Mongoose explains the warnings in their [documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/deprecations.html).

It's also a good habit to `console.log` a success message to tell you you've connected to your database. I once spent an hour trying to debug a database connection simply because I wasn't telling myself it was connected.

In the `catch` block, `console.error` any error you receive and use `process.exit(1)` to terminate the process if an error occurs.

Finally, export the `connectDB` function.

Your `db.js` file should now look like this.

```js
// db.js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const db = process.env.DB_URI;

async function connectDB() {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(db, {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
    console.log("MongoDB connected");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

module.exports = connectDB;
```

### Step 5 - Time to Connect to Your Database

In your `app.js` file, require `dotenv` and call the `config` method on it.

Import the `connectDB` function and call it.

```js
// app.js
require("dotenv").config();
const express = require("express");
const connectDB = require("./db");
const port = 3000;

// Connect to database
connectDB();

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Your app is listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Congratulations, your Node app is now connected to your MongoDB Atlas cluster. If you run `node app.js`, you'll see two messages printed to your console: that your app is running and that you've connected to your database. From here you can start to write schemas and perform CRUD operations with your data.

If you ran into any issues, [the code for this demo app](https://github.com/gerhynes/node-mongodb-atlas) is in this repo.
